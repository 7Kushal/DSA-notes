Better -> Finding length of both the ll and then starting from the next start point for larger ll
Best/Optimal ->Using tortoise algorithm ->
    
    How ? 
    1.Start from the head of both the linked list 
    2.if any pointer reached null -> swap them and start again 
    3.if at any point both reached null -> no intersaction else they will collide and return the answer
