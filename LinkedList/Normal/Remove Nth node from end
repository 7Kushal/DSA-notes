Brute ->  you can find length of the linked list and then move from head less then N and unlink it 
Best/Better -> using tortoise and hair algo.  

How ? 
        Assume an temp pointer and move it till N times 
        Now Take one more pointer start = head
        Move both the pointer till temp reaches null -> now temp will reach null exaclty after L - N moves that means We
        can now delete start node 
        TC - > O(N) SC - O(constant)
